APD-Toolkit Installation Guide

Windows

Step 1: Install GitShell

Step 2: Start GitShell and download the APD-Toolkit files with 
	git clone https://github.com/JLuebben/APD-Toolkit /some/local/path/

Step 3: Setup environment variables. To make sure Python knows where the APD-Toolkit files are located /some/local/path/bin must be added to your operating system's PATH enviroment variables.

Step 4: Test if everything works by opening a terminal and type APDToolkit.

Linux

Do the same steps as in the Windows description except installing GitShell. Any shell will do the trick.
